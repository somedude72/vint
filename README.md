## Overview

Welcome to the vint library!

Vint is an arbitrary precision integer and floating point library in c++. It does not require any dependencies to compile other than the standard template library in c++. At least c++11 is required to compile vint.

This library is currently in pre-alpha development: API will change and break without warning. Please do not use this unless you would like to test or contribute to it. Additionally, documentation may refer to some unimplemented features. Please refer to the [project roadmap](https://somedudex.github.io/vint/home#project-roadmap) for more information on the status of a specific feature.

## Getting Started

Head over to the [quickstart guide](https://somedudex.github.io/vint/home#quickstart) for a step by step guide on the installation of this library. Alternatively, check out the [tutorial](https://somedudex.github.io/vint/tutorial) to see some basic usages of the features provided by vint.

Vint is inspired by and implemented similar to Python's integer object. Please refer to the [documentation page](https://somedudex.github.io/vint/home) for more information on its implementation.
