## Overview

Welcome to the vint library!

Vint is an arbitrary precision integer and floating point library in c++. It does not require any dependencies to compile other than the standard template library in c++. At least c++11 is required to compile vint.

This library is currently in pre-alpha development: API will change and break without warning. Please do not use this unless you would like to test or contribute to it. Additionally, documentation may refer to some unimplemented features. Please refer to the [project roadmap](https://somedudex.github.io/vint/home#project-roadmap) for more information on the status of a specific feature.
